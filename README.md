## <a name='overview'>üê± Overview</a>

The purpose of this project is for you to create/implement some design patterns depending on the situation.

## <a name='exercises'>üê® Exercises</a>

### = Ex.01 - Deck of Cards

Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards.<br />
How you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.


### = Ex.02 - Call Center

Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: `respondent`, `manager`,
and `director`.<br />
An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free.

If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager.<br />
If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director.

Design the classes and data structures for this problem.<br />

### = Ex.03 - Jukebox

Design a musical jukebox using object oriented principles. 

### = Ex.04 - Parking Lot

Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles. 

### = Ex.05 - Online Book Reader

Design the data structures for an online book reader system. 

### = Ex.06 - Jigsaw

Design the data structures for a NxN jigsaw puzzle.<br />

### = Ex.07 - Chat Server

Explain how you would design a chat server.<br />
In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods.

### = Ex.08 - Othello

Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other.<br />
When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and
bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped.

On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent's pieces. <br />

The game ends when either user has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces.

Design the object-oriented design for Othello.

### = Ex.09 - Circular Array

Design a CircularArray class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated.<br />

If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard f or (Obj o : circularArray) notation.
